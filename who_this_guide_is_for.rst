Who This Guide is For
=====================

FreePBX Guide is written exclusively for developers (computer programmers)
wanting to:

- Contribute code to the FreePBX project.
- Build their own FreePBX modules and services to extend base FreePBX
  functionality.

If you're not a developer, this guide is probably not for you.

Before continuing, you should have a basic understanding of the following
technologies:

- Linux
- `Asterisk <http://www.asterisk.org/>`_
- `FreePBX <http://www.freepbx.org/>`_
- `PHP <http://www.php.net/>`_

If you're not familiar with Asterisk, I'd highly recommend reading the book
`Asterisk: The Definitive Guide <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517343/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rdegges-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596517343>`_,
which is (in my humble opinion) the best book ever written on Asterisk.

.. note::
    Although you don't need to be an expert at PHP, having a basic understanding
    of the language will help as you go through the book, since FreePBX is
    written in PHP and we'll be discussing code samples as we go along.
