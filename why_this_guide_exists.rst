Why This Guide Exists
=====================


FreePBX is one of the largest open source PBX systems in the world, with over
500,000 active users and more than 5,000,000 downloads to date.

With so many users, FreePBX has gained a lot of attention from hobbyists, system
administrators, and even large enterprises as it allows the smallest (and
largest) of companies to deploy a stable and feature-rich phone system at no
cost.

As time has gone on, and the platform has become more and more advanced,
developers have had a harder and harder time working on the platform as there
are no FreePBX development guides that walk new developers through the basics
needed to contribute to the project, as well as build their own FreePBX modules
and services.

The purpose of this guide is to teach you:

- How to contribute code to the FreePBX project successfully.
- How to build your own FreePBX modules.
- Which style conventions you should use while writing code.
- What things you should avoid doing.
- Useful tips and tricks to make your life easier.

Over time, this guide will continue to be updated to reflect modern FreePBX
practices, and will evolve alongside the project to ensure developers have an
easy way to get started doing what they do best: hacking code.
